# Canumb - The number cruncher

Aims to be a simple conversion tool between various bases. Currently
2 (binary), 8 (octal), 10 (decimal) and 16 (hexadecimal) is supported.

Only unsigned numbers at this point, feel free to help out improve support.

It includes a hefty web frontend which makes usage easy. Single-page
applications seems to be the latest buzz right now, and so this follows
that vision.

## See it in action
A deployment of canumb is [available at heroku](https://canumb.herokuapp.com).
